# each M&M in UNISONO provides a number of data items it can measure, monitor or
# gather in some way. New data items must be specified here.
#
# name is the global name for a specified data item
# type defines its type, can be: 
#      (n)ode      for node specific data items (doesn't need an identifier)
#      (i)nterface for network interface specific data items (needs an
#                  identifier to identify the correspondent interface)
#      (l)ink      for link properties, whereby a link is the end-to-end
#                  connection between to nodes (therefore, it requires 2
#                  identifiers)
#
# name					type	explanation
# Data items for link properties (2 identifier)
